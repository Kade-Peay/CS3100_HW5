Module 10: 
    Definitions:
        - Community: Biotic(living) members 
            ~ Plants and animals 
        - Ecosystem: biotic and abiotic(nonliving) members and parts 
            ~ Biotic: Plants and animals 
            ~ Abiotic: Weather, water, mineral soil components, topography
    
    Ecosystems are Comprised of Communities - Example:
        Forest ecosysstem is comprised of the plants and animal communities 
            - Soil microorganisms up to megaherbivores 
            - Single-celled plants up to towering trees 
        
        The abiotic parts might include the drainages, weather patterns, 
        lakes and rivers, aspect of the land and terrain type 
    
    Ecosystem Properties:
        - Dynamic 
        - Scale is important 
        - Size is difficult to measure 
        - Boundaries difficult to define 
        - Generally self-sustaining 
        - Matter cycles in ecosystems 
        - energy powers matter cycling 
        
    Matter:
        Matter occupies space and has mass 
        Matter cycles in an ecosystem 
        Matter is the atoms and compounds that make up plants and animals 

    Energy:
        The capacity to do work 
        Energy moves matter around in an ecosystem 
        The sun is the source of all past, present, and future energy on the Earth 
        Energy is NOT cycled in an ecosystem, it is diminished as it moves matter around 
    
    Copmlexity and Stability:
        In general, more complexity equals more stability 
        If one part of a copmlex web is removed it has less effect than if you remove 
        one part of a simple web 
    
    Niche:
        Each plant and animal species has a unique role in an excosystem
        Niche is comprised of dimensions 
        Number of dimensions is unknown - niches are n-dimensional 
        Species survive only as long as they compete successfully and are 
        adapted to the environment 
        As a result of the above, no two species have exactly the same niche 

    Range of Tolerance:
        For any environmental dimension, a given species has a range of Tolerance  
        Groups of species with similar ranges of tolerance form communities 

        Some ranges for dimensions are wide 
            - Wide range of foods eaten 
            - If all ranges wide - generalist 
        
        Some ranges for dimensions are narrow
            - Narrow range of foods eaten 
            - If all ranges narrow - specialist 
        
        Management perspective 
            - Transplants and reintroductions 
        
    Patterns in Space: 
        Ecological equivalents:
            - Species differ between communities but have similar morphological 
            and physiological adaptations 
         For example, softwood forests exist in North and South America, Europe, 
         Asia, and Australia 
    
    Patterns in Time:
        Succession is the sequential process of change in ecosystems 

    Succession and Communities:
        Pioneer Community:
            - First step following distrubance 
            - Characterized by a turnover species 
        Climax Community:
            - Final step following disturbance 
            - Characterized by a turnover of individuals 
            - Reaches dynamic equilibrium 
    
    Succession Types:
        Primary:
            - Majority of life is removed 
            - Volcano, new island formed, mudslide 
            - Rare
        Secondary:
            - Remnants of previous community exist 
            - Patchiness of fire 
    
Module 11: 
    Definitions:
        - All of the plants and animals in an area 
        - Must consider the interactions 
        - Scale is important
        - Levels of diversity are important 
    
    Levels of Biodiversity:
        Genetic: Within a species 
        Species: Basic unit for study
        Ecosystem: Between species 

    Reasons to Maintain Biodiversity:
        - Ethical/Aesthetic
        - Economic Benefits
        - Ecological Interactions 

        - All of these are connected 
    
    Ethical/Aesthetic:
        - Human moral obligation 
        - Humans are part of the system 
        - Lack of understanding of system 
    
    Economic Benefits:
        - Domesticated stock came from wild 
        - Plants and animals 
        - Medicines 
        - Food - fish 
        - Natural products - wood 

    Ecological Interactions:
        - Oxygen cycle 
        - Nitrogen cycle 
        - Hydrologic cycle 
        - Pollination 
        - Soil formation 
        - Decomposers 

Module 12:
    Recall: 
        Genotype: the genetic constitution of an individual organism
        Phenotype: the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting 
            from the interaction of its genotype with the environment

        Basically the genotype is the actual things passed down and the phenotype are just the characteristics

        Sexual vs Asexual: asexual reproduction generates offspring that are genetically identical
        to a single parent. In sexual reproduction, the two parents contribute genetic information 
        to produce unique offspring
    
    Introduction to Genetics:
        Cells are the fundamental working units of every living system 
        
        DNA from all organisms is made up of the same chemical and physical components 
        
        The DNA sequence is the particular side-by-side arrangement of bases along the DNA strand on a chromosome 
        
        Each chromosome contains many genes, the basic physical and functional units of heredity 
        
        Proteins perform most life functions and even make up the majority of cellular structures

    Ethical Concerns:
        Fairness in the use of genetic information 

        Privacy and confidentiality 

        Psychological impact and stigmatization 

        Reproductive issues 

        Clinical issues 

        Uncertainties associated with gene tests 

        Conceptual and philosophical implications
